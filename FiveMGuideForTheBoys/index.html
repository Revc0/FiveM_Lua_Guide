                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Embark on a journey into GTA Modding...</p>
                <div class="sub-section">
                    <h3>Grasping GTA Modding</h3>
                    <p>GTA V modding is the practice of altering the game’s original content, introducing new features,
                        experiences, and game mechanics to make the game more enjoyable and diverse. Though not
                        officially supported by Rockstar, there's a robust community actively developing and using mods,
                        with FiveM being a notable framework for modding.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts in GTA V Modding:</h3>
                    <div class="sub-section">
                        <h4>Resources</h4>
                        <p>Resources are essential units within a FiveM server, containing mods or scripts that modify
                            gameplay. Written mainly in LUA, resources can also utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                            develop user interfaces, contributing to immersive gaming experiences.</p>

                        <h4>Client-Side vs. Server-Side Scripts</h4>
                        <p>Client-side scripts run on individual players’ devices, dealing with personalized user
                            interfaces and visual elements. In contrast, server-side scripts operate on the server,
                            managing game logic and player interactions. This delineation is crucial for developing
                            coherent scripts that offer synchronized gameplay.</p>

                        <h4>Events</h4>
                        <p>Events, initiated by servers or clients, act as triggers within the game. They respond to
                            player actions, environmental changes, or conditions set in scripts. Effectively managing
                            events is fundamental for developing dynamic, responsive scripts that enhance the gaming
                            experience.</p>

                        <h4>Natives</h4>
                        <p>Natives, predefined functions provided by the game engine, are tools for interacting with the
                            game’s environment and mechanics. Utilizing natives, developers can craft diverse mods,
                            ranging from simple tweaks to extensive game overhauls.</p>

                        <h4>Networking</h4>
                        <p>Networking is imperative in GTA V’s multiplayer setting, ensuring data synchronization
                            between servers and clients. Proficient use of networking principles results in mods that
                            support seamless interactions and responsive gameplay, fostering an engaging multiplayer
                            environment.</p>

                <h2>Transitioning Skills to LUA</h2>
                <p>Moving from other programming languages to LUA for FiveM scripting...</p>
                <div class="sub-section">
                    <h3>LUA Syntax and Semantics Essentials</h3>
                    <p>LUA syntax is known for its simplicity. For beginners, it's important to note that variables in
                        LUA don't need explicit declaration before assignment. A statement like <code>variable =
                            25</code> is completely valid. When you assign a value to a variable, LUA automatically
                        understands that the variable exists. Also, be mindful that comparison operations use '==', not
                        '=' which is used for assignment.</p>

                    <p>LUA also relies on conventional control structures like <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, and
                        <code>for</code> loops, making it relatively easy for beginners to pick up. A fundamental
                        concept in LUA is the function. Functions in LUA can be assigned to variables, passed as
                        arguments into other functions, and returned as values, providing a great deal of flexibility
                        and power in your scripts.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding LUA Data Types</h3>
                    <p>It’s essential to familiarize yourself with the basic data types in LUA as they form the backbone
                        of scripting:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>nil</code>: This represents the absence of a value. For instance, if you try to print
                            a variable that hasn't been assigned a value, it will return <code>nil</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>boolean</code>: With only two possible values, true or false, booleans are
                            straightforward and vital for controlling flow with conditional statements.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>number</code>: LUA doesn’t differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers,
                            simplifying operations involving numeric values.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>string</code>: Sequences of characters. Remember to enclose them in either single or
                            double quotes.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>function</code>: In LUA, functions are first-class citizens and can be used in the
                            same ways as other data types, like numbers and strings.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>userdata</code>: This advanced feature allows arbitrary C data to be stored in LUA
                            variables, used mostly when integrating with C libraries.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>thread</code>: Threads support coroutines or collaborative multitasking, a topic that
                            might require deeper study as you progress in your understanding of LUA.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>table</code>: This is LUA’s only data structuring mechanism and is used to represent
                            arrays, sets, records, etc. Tables are immensely flexible, and understanding their use is
                            crucial for effective LUA scripting.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Transition Insights: JavaScript to LUA</h3>
                    <p>For developers with a JavaScript background, it’s essential to understand how LUA mimics
                        object-oriented programming. Instead of objects and methods, LUA uses tables and functions.
                        Also, while JavaScript has both <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> values, LUA only
                        has <code>nil</code> to represent the absence of a value. Remember that in LUA, variable scope
                        is vital: while global variables can be declared freely, local variables must be preceded with
                        the <code>local</code> keyword to be declared properly.</p>

                    <h3>FiveM Forum, Popular Creators, Cheat-Sheets</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/" target="_blank">FiveM Forum</a> is a platform where you can
                        find discussions related to FiveM scripting, view and release scripts, seek help, and engage
                        with other community members. In the forum, you can also discover scripts shared by popular
                        creators in the community; examining these scripts can provide insights into different styles
                        and techniques of LUA scripting. There are also cheat-sheets available online that consolidate
                        essential LUA syntax and functions, serving as quick references as you write and debug your
                        scripts. Using these resources, start by understanding and making small modifications to
                        existing scripts, and then try developing your own as you become more familiar with LUA.

                <h2>First Steps in Scripting</h2>
                <p>Let’s begin scripting for FiveM.</p>
                <div class="sub-section">
                    <h3>Creating Your First Usable Script</h3>
                    <p>Start with a script that offers functionality in a FiveM roleplay server. A script for a new
                        player command is a practical starting point.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding Resource Files and Directories</h3>
                    <p>Resources need their folder within the ‘resources’ directory, accompanied by a ‘fxmanifest.lua’
                        file for metadata and script references.</p>

                    <h3>Building a Simple Custom Command</h3>
                    <p>A ‘/hello’ command can be your initial script. It’s client-initiated but needs server processing,
                        giving you a feel for both client-side and server-side scripting.</p>

                    <h3>Learning from the Community</h3>
                    <p>The FiveM community is active with experienced developers sharing their work. Creators like <a
                            href="https://github.com/qbcore-framework" target="_blank">qbcore-framework</a> and <a
                            href="https://github.com/esx-framework" target="_blank">esx-framework</a> have shared
                        scripts and resources on GitHub. Study their code, observe their style, and learn their
                        implementation methods.</p>

                    <h3>Referencing Cheatsheets and Frameworks</h3>
                    <p>Cheatsheets provide quick help and guidance. Understanding frameworks like QBcore and ESX is
                        crucial, as they offer platforms for advanced mods. Take the time to learn their styles,
                        conventions, and methodologies.</p>

                    <h2>First Script Exercise: Blip Maker</h2>
                    <p>Now, let's walk through a practical exercise to create a simple Blip Maker script for a FiveM
                        server running on the QBcore framework. This script will enable you to create a blip at a
                        specified location on the game map, providing a hands-on experience in crafting a usable script
                        for FiveM roleplay servers.</p>

                        <h3>Script Explanation</h3>
                        <p>
                            The <code>fxmanifest.lua</code> file is necessary for FiveM to recognize your resource. It
                            defines the metadata and client-side scripts for your resource, and it specifies that the
                            resource depends on 'qb-core'.
                            <br><br>
                            The <code>client.lua</code> script initializes the <code>QBCore</code> object, which is
                            essential for working with the QBcore framework. It then registers a command named <code>blip</code>.
                            When this command is used in the game with the right arguments (name, x, y, z), it triggers
                            the <code>blipmaker:createBlip</code> event with those arguments. The event handler for
                            <code>blipmaker:createBlip</code> then creates a blip at the specified coordinates with the
                            given name.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Testing Your Script</h3>
                        <p>
                            To test your script, place the <code>blipmaker</code> folder in the <code>resources</code>
                            directory of your FiveM server. Then, add <code>start blipmaker</code> to your server’s
                            <code>server.cfg</code> file. Once you’ve done that, start your server, join it, and use the
                            <code>/blip</code> command followed by the name and coordinates where you want the blip to
                            appear.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Practice Exercise</h3>
                        <p>For practice, try modifying the sprite, color, and scale of the blip. Experiment with adding
                            more commands and functionalities. Explore the QBcore documentation and learn about other
                            functions and features you can integrate into your script.</p>

                        triggered, it will execute the function, which sends a chat message to the player welcoming them
                        to the server.</p>

                    <h3>Natives and Game Element Manipulation</h3>
                    <p>Now let’s use natives to spawn a car:</p>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Using Natives to Spawn a Vehicle</span>
RegisterCommand("car", function(source, args, rawCommand)
    local vehicleName = args[1] or "adder"
    RequestModel(vehicleName)

    while not HasModelLoaded(vehicleName) do
        Wait(500)
    end

    local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
    local pos = GetEntityCoords(playerPed)
    local vehicle = CreateVehicle(vehicleName, pos.x, pos.y, pos.z, GetEntityHeading(playerPed), true, false)

    TaskWarpPedIntoVehicle(playerPed, vehicle, -1)
end, false)
        </pre>
                    <p>This script registers a command <code>/car</code> that spawns a car. The player types <code>/car
                        [vehicleName]</code>, and the script requests and loads the vehicle model, gets the player's
                        position, creates the vehicle at the player’s location, and warps the player into the driver’s
                        seat.</p>

                    <h3>Integrating Interactive UIs</h3>
                    <p>For a responsive UI, consider this example:</p>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Sending data to HTML/JS UI</span>
RegisterNUICallback('main', function(data, cb)
    SetDisplay(false)
    cb('ok')
end)

function SetDisplay(bool)
    display = bool
    SetNuiFocus(bool, bool)
    SendNUIMessage({
        type = "ui",
        status = bool,
    })
end)
        </pre>
                    <p>In this example, the Lua script interacts with an NUI (HTML/JS) interface. It registers an NUI
                        callback, which is triggered by the UI. The script then hides the UI and sends confirmation back
                        to the UI. Ensure your HTML file is well-structured, with event listeners set up to communicate
                        with the Lua script. Linking the HTML file with the Lua script is typically done within your
                        resource manifest file, like <code>fxmanifest.lua</code>, by defining the HTML file as a
                        'ui_page'.</p>

                    <p>To visualize in-game: place the HTML file with your UI in the resource directory, ensure it's
                        referenced in the manifest, start the server, join the game, and execute the relevant commands
                        or triggers to interact with your UI.</p>

            <section id="server-side-scripting">
                <h2>Server-Side Scripting Essentials</h2>
                <p>Delve deeper into the world of server-side scripting for comprehensive and effective FiveM mods.</p>
                <div class="sub-section">
                    <h3>Handling Server-Side Events</h3>
                    <p>Server-side events are imperative in managing game states and player interactions. For
                        example:</p>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Server-Side Event</span>
RegisterServerEvent('playerJoined')
AddEventHandler('playerJoined', function()
    local player = source
    print(GetPlayerName(player) .. " joined the server.")
end)
        </pre>
                    <p>This code snippet registers and handles a 'playerJoined' event, announcing in the console when a
                        player joins the server.</p>

                    <h3>Creating and Managing Custom Game Modes</h3>
                    <p>Custom game modes provide unique experiences. Let’s illustrate with an auto-respawn mode:</p>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Auto-Respawn Game Mode</span>
RegisterServerEvent('startAutoRespawnMode')
AddEventHandler('startAutoRespawnMode', function()
    print("Auto Respawn Mode Activated")
end)

AddEventHandler('playerDropped', function(reason)
    local player = source
    print(GetPlayerName(player) .. " left the server. Reason: " .. reason)
end)

AddEventHandler('playerConnecting', function(name, setKickReason, deferrals)
    local player = source
    print(name .. " is connecting to the server...")
    -- Add your respawn logic here
end)
        </pre>
                    <p>This code starts an auto-respawn game mode. When a player drops, it logs the reason, and upon a
                        player connecting, it indicates they are joining. Place your respawn logic in the designated
                        area.</p>

                    <h3>Working with Server Data and Databases</h3>
                    <p>Data management is fundamental. For instance:</p>
                    <pre>
<span class="comment">-- Lua: MySQL Data Interaction</span>
MySQL.ready(function ()
    MySQL.Async.fetchAll('SELECT * FROM players', {}, function(players)
        print(players[1].name)  -- Adjust with actual column name
    end)
end)
        </pre>
                    <p>This script interacts with a MySQL database, retrieving and printing player names from a
                        'players' table. Modify the SQL query and table structure to fit your database.</p>

                            implementation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Effective Development Workflow</h3>
                    <p>The development process is iterative and systematic:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Start with a clear vision. Whether it's a new piece of clothing,
                            a vehicle, a job, or a script, know what you want to achieve. Define the scope, objectives,
                            and specifications of your resource. In the case of scripts, understand the functionalities
                            they should provide and how they’ll interact with other game elements.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Designing:</strong> Visualize your resource. Draft designs for clothing and
                            vehicles, and create pseudocode or flowcharts for scripts. For scripts, plan the logic,
                            structure, and flow before diving into coding. Understand the user experience, define the
                            user interface (if any), and think about the potential scenarios in which your script will
                            be used.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Developing:</strong> This is where your plan comes to life. Write the code for
                            scripts, create 3D models for clothing and vehicles, or configure meta files. Follow best
                            practices, maintain clean and organized code, and ensure your resource is optimized for
                            performance. For scripts, develop in increments, adding and testing functionalities one at a
                            time. Utilize version control systems like Git to manage and track your development
                            progress.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> A crucial step in development. Test each resource thoroughly to
                            identify bugs, glitches, and performance issues. For scripts, conduct both unit testing
                            (testing individual functions) and integration testing (testing the script as a whole).
                            Ensure compatibility with existing game elements and other scripts, and make necessary
                            adjustments.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Iterating:</strong> Based on testing feedback, make improvements and refinements to
                            your resources. Optimization is key, whether for scripts, models, or any other assets.
                            Iterate until you achieve a polished, reliable resource that enhances the gaming experience
                            without causing disruptions or performance issues.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Repeat this workflow for each resource you develop, continually learning and refining your
                        process as you gain more experience and familiarity with FiveM’s modding ecosystem.</p>
