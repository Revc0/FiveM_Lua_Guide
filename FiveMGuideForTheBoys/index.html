            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Everything you need to know before making your own GTA scripts, clothing, vehicles, MLO'S.</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Grasping GTA Modding</h3>
                <p>GTA V modding is the practice of altering the game’s original content, introducing new features,
                    experiences, and game mechanics to make the game more enjoyable and diverse. Though not
                    officially supported by Rockstar, there's a robust community actively developing and using mods,
                    with FiveM being a notable framework for modding.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts in GTA V Modding:</h3>
                <div class="sub-section">
                    <h4>Resources</h4>
                    <p>Resources are essential units within a FiveM server, containing mods or scripts that modify
                        gameplay. Written mainly in LUA, resources can also utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
                        develop user interfaces, contributing to immersive gaming experiences.</p>

                    <h4>Client-Side vs. Server-Side Scripts</h4>
                    <p>Client-side scripts run on individual players’ devices, dealing with personalized user
                        interfaces and visual elements. In contrast, server-side scripts operate on the server,
                        managing game logic and player interactions. This delineation is crucial for developing
                        coherent scripts that offer synchronized gameplay.</p>

                    <h4>Events</h4>
                    <p>Events, initiated by servers or clients, act as triggers within the game. They respond to
                        player actions, environmental changes, or conditions set in scripts. Effectively managing
                        events is fundamental for developing dynamic, responsive scripts that enhance the gaming
                        experience.</p>

                    <h4>Natives</h4>
                    <p>Natives, predefined functions provided by the game engine, are tools for interacting with the
                        game’s environment and mechanics. Utilizing natives, developers can craft diverse mods,
                        ranging from simple tweaks to extensive game overhauls.</p>

                    <h4>Networking</h4>
                    <p>Networking is imperative in GTA V’s multiplayer setting, ensuring data synchronization
                        between servers and clients. Proficient use of networking principles results in mods that
                        support seamless interactions and responsive gameplay, fostering an engaging multiplayer
                        environment.</p>

            <h2>Transitioning Skills to LUA</h2>
            <p>Moving from other programming languages to LUA for FiveM scripting...</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>LUA Syntax and Semantics Essentials</h3>
                <p>LUA syntax is known for its simplicity. For beginners, it's important to note that variables in
                    LUA don't need explicit declaration before assignment. A statement like <code>variable =
                        25</code> is completely valid. When you assign a value to a variable, LUA automatically
                    understands that the variable exists. Also, be mindful that comparison operations use '==', not
                    '=' which is used for assignment.</p>

                <p>LUA also relies on conventional control structures like <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, and
                    <code>for</code> loops, making it relatively easy for beginners to pick up. A fundamental
                    concept in LUA is the function. Functions in LUA can be assigned to variables, passed as
                    arguments into other functions, and returned as values, providing a great deal of flexibility
                    and power in your scripts.</p>

                <h3>Understanding LUA Data Types</h3>
                <p>It’s essential to familiarize yourself with the basic data types in LUA as they form the backbone
                    of scripting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">nil</code>// This represents the absence of a value. For instance, if
                        you try to print
                        a variable that hasn't been assigned a value, it will return <code>nil</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">boolean</code>// With only two possible values, true or false,
                        booleans are
                        straightforward and vital for controlling flow with conditional statements.
                    </li>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">number</code>// LUA doesn’t differentiate between integers and
                        floating-point numbers,
                        simplifying operations involving numeric values.
                    </li>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">string</code>// Sequences of characters. Remember to enclose them in
                        either single or
                        double quotes.
                    </li>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">function</code>// In LUA, functions are first-class citizens and can
                        be used in the
                        same ways as other data types, like numbers and strings.
                    </li>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">userdata</code>// This advanced feature allows arbitrary C data to be
                        stored in LUA
                        variables, used mostly when integrating with C libraries.
                    </li>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">thread</code>// Threads support coroutines or collaborative
                        multitasking, a topic that
                        might require deeper study as you progress in your understanding of LUA.
                    </li>
                    <li><code class="language-lua">table</code>// This is LUA’s only data structuring mechanism and is
                        used to represent
                        arrays, sets, records, etc. Tables are immensely flexible, and understanding their use is
                        crucial for effective LUA scripting.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Transition Insights: JavaScript to LUA</h3>
                <p>For developers with a JavaScript background, it’s essential to understand how LUA mimics
                    object-oriented programming. Instead of objects and methods, LUA uses tables and functions.
                    Also, while JavaScript has both <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> values, LUA only
                    has <code>nil</code> to represent the absence of a value. Remember that in LUA, variable scope
                    is vital: while global variables can be declared freely, local variables must be preceded with
                    the <code>local</code> keyword to be declared properly.</p>

                <h3>FiveM Forum, Popular Creators, Cheat-Sheets</h3>
                <p>The <a href="https://forum.cfx.re/" target="_blank">FiveM Forum</a> is a platform where you can
                    find discussions related to FiveM scripting, view and release scripts, seek help, and engage
                    with other community members. In the forum, you can also discover scripts shared by popular
                    creators in the community; examining these scripts can provide insights into different styles
                    and techniques of LUA scripting. There are also cheat-sheets available online that consolidate
                    essential LUA syntax and functions, serving as quick references as you write and debug your
                    scripts. Using these resources, start by understanding and making small modifications to
                    existing scripts, and then try developing your own as you become more familiar with LUA.

                    crucial, as they offer platforms for advanced mods. Take the time to learn their styles,
                    conventions, and methodologies.</p>

                <h2>First Script Exercise: Blip Maker</h2>
                <p>Now, let's walk through a practical exercise to create a simple Blip Maker script for a FiveM
                    server running on the QBcore framework. This script will enable you to create a blip at a
                    specified location on the game map, providing a hands-on experience in crafting a usable script
                    for FiveM roleplay servers.</p>

                    <h3>Script Explanation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <code>fxmanifest.lua</code> file is necessary for FiveM to recognize your resource. It
                        defines the metadata and client-side scripts for your resource, and it specifies that the
                        resource depends on 'qb-core'.
                        <br><br>
                        The <code>client.lua</code> script initializes the <code>QBCore</code> object, which is
                        essential for working with the QBcore framework. It then registers a command named
                        <code>blip</code>.
                        When this command is used in the game with the right arguments (name, x, y, z), it triggers
                        the <code>blipmaker:createBlip</code> event with those arguments. The event handler for
                        <code>blipmaker:createBlip</code> then creates a blip at the specified coordinates with the
                        given name.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Testing Your Script</h3>
                    <p>
                        To test your script, place the <code>blipmaker</code> folder in the <code>resources</code>
                        directory of your FiveM server. Then, add <code>start blipmaker</code> to your server’s
                        <code>server.cfg</code> file. Once you’ve done that, start your server, join it, and use the
                        <code>/blip</code> command followed by the name and coordinates where you want the blip to
                        appear.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Practice Exercise</h3>
                    <p>For practice, try modifying the sprite, color, and scale of the blip. Experiment with adding
                        more commands and functionalities. Explore the QBcore documentation and learn about other
                        functions and features you can integrate into your script.</p>

    TriggerEvent('chatMessage', "SERVER", {255, 0, 0}, "Welcome to Our FiveM Server!")
end)
                </code>
        </pre>
                <p>Here, we register a client-side event called <code>'showWelcome'</code>. When this event is
                    triggered, it will execute the function, which sends a chat message to the player welcoming them
                    to the server.</p>

                <h3>Natives and Game Element Manipulation</h3>
                <p>Now let’s use natives to spawn a car:</p>
                <pre> <code class="language-lua">
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Using Natives to Spawn a Vehicle</span>
RegisterCommand("car", function(source, args, rawCommand)
    local vehicleName = args[1] or "adder"
    RequestModel(vehicleName)

    while not HasModelLoaded(vehicleName) do
        Wait(500)
    end

    local playerPed = PlayerPedId()
    local pos = GetEntityCoords(playerPed)
    local vehicle = CreateVehicle(vehicleName, pos.x, pos.y, pos.z, GetEntityHeading(playerPed), true, false)

    TaskWarpPedIntoVehicle(playerPed, vehicle, -1)
end, false)
                </code>
        </pre>
                <p>This script registers a command <code>/car</code> that spawns a car. The player types <code>/car
                    [vehicleName]</code>, and the script requests and loads the vehicle model, gets the player's
                    position, creates the vehicle at the player’s location, and warps the player into the driver’s
                    seat.</p>

                <h3>Integrating Interactive UIs</h3>
                <p>For a responsive UI, consider this example:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-lua">
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Sending data to HTML/JS UI</span>
RegisterNUICallback('main', function(data, cb)
    SetDisplay(false)
    cb('ok')
end)

function SetDisplay(bool)
    display = bool
    SetNuiFocus(bool, bool)
    SendNUIMessage({
        type = "ui",
        status = bool,
    })
end)
                </code>
        </pre>
                <p>In this example, the Lua script interacts with an NUI (HTML/JS) interface. It registers an NUI
                    callback, which is triggered by the UI. The script then hides the UI and sends confirmation back
                    to the UI. Ensure your HTML file is well-structured, with event listeners set up to communicate
                    with the Lua script. Linking the HTML file with the Lua script is typically done within your
                    resource manifest file, like <code>fxmanifest.lua</code>, by defining the HTML file as a
                    'ui_page'.</p>

                <p>To visualize in-game: place the HTML file with your UI in the resource directory, ensure it's
                    referenced in the manifest, start the server, join the game, and execute the relevant commands
                    or triggers to interact with your UI.</p>

        <section id="server-side-scripting">
            <h2>Server-Side Scripting Essentials</h2>
            <p>Delve deeper into the world of server-side scripting for comprehensive and effective FiveM mods.</p>
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Handling Server-Side Events</h3>
                <p>Server-side events are imperative in managing game states and player interactions. For
                    example:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-lua">
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Server-Side Event</span>
RegisterServerEvent('playerJoined')
AddEventHandler('playerJoined', function()
    local player = source
    print(GetPlayerName(player) .. " joined the server.")
end)
                </code>
        </pre>
                <p>This code snippet registers and handles a 'playerJoined' event, announcing in the console when a
                    player joins the server.</p>

                <h3>Creating and Managing Custom Game Modes</h3>
                <p>Custom game modes provide unique experiences. Let’s illustrate with an auto-respawn mode:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-lua">
<span class="comment">-- Lua: Auto-Respawn Game Mode</span>
RegisterServerEvent('startAutoRespawnMode')
AddEventHandler('startAutoRespawnMode', function()
    print("Auto Respawn Mode Activated")
end)

AddEventHandler('playerDropped', function(reason)
    local player = source
    print(GetPlayerName(player) .. " left the server. Reason: " .. reason)
end)

AddEventHandler('playerConnecting', function(name, setKickReason, deferrals)
    local player = source
    print(name .. " is connecting to the server...")
    -- Add your respawn logic here
end)
                </code>
        </pre>
                <p>This code starts an auto-respawn game mode. When a player drops, it logs the reason, and upon a
                    player connecting, it indicates they are joining. Place your respawn logic in the designated
                    area.</p>

                <h3>Working with Server Data and Databases</h3>
                <p>Data management is fundamental. For instance:</p>
                <pre> <code class="language-lua">
<span class="comment">-- Lua: MySQL Data Interaction</span>
MySQL.ready(function ()
    MySQL.Async.fetchAll('SELECT * FROM players', {}, function(players)
        print(players[1].name)  -- Adjust with actual column name
    end)
end)
                    </code>
        </pre>
                <p>This script interacts with a MySQL database, retrieving and printing player names from a
                    'players' table. Modify the SQL query and table structure to fit your database.</p>

                        type. Familiarize yourself with its structure and parameters for effective custom weapon
                        implementation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Effective Development Workflow</h3>
                <p>The development process is iterative and systematic:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Start with a clear vision. Whether it's a new piece of clothing,
                        a vehicle, a job, or a script, know what you want to achieve. Define the scope, objectives,
                        and specifications of your resource. In the case of scripts, understand the functionalities
                        they should provide and how they’ll interact with other game elements.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Designing:</strong> Visualize your resource. Draft designs for clothing and
                        vehicles, and create pseudocode or flowcharts for scripts. For scripts, plan the logic,
                        structure, and flow before diving into coding. Understand the user experience, define the
                        user interface (if any), and think about the potential scenarios in which your script will
                        be used.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Developing:</strong> This is where your plan comes to life. Write the code for
                        scripts, create 3D models for clothing and vehicles, or configure meta files. Follow best
                        practices, maintain clean and organized code, and ensure your resource is optimized for
                        performance. For scripts, develop in increments, adding and testing functionalities one at a
                        time. Utilize version control systems like Git to manage and track your development
                        progress.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> A crucial step in development. Test each resource thoroughly to
                        identify bugs, glitches, and performance issues. For scripts, conduct both unit testing
                        (testing individual functions) and integration testing (testing the script as a whole).
                        Ensure compatibility with existing game elements and other scripts, and make necessary
                        adjustments.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Iterating:</strong> Based on testing feedback, make improvements and refinements to
                        your resources. Optimization is key, whether for scripts, models, or any other assets.
                        Iterate until you achieve a polished, reliable resource that enhances the gaming experience
                        without causing disruptions or performance issues.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Repeat this workflow for each resource you develop, continually learning and refining your
                    process as you gain more experience and familiarity with FiveM’s modding ecosystem.</p>

        <section id="networking-fivem">
            <h2>Advanced Networking in FiveM Scripting</h2>
            <p>The key to FiveM scripting lies in a deep understanding of networking principles to ensure a
                consistent, secure, and responsive multiplayer experience. This section elucidates crucial
                networking components in FiveM scripting.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Data Synchronization Explained</h3>
                <p>Data synchronization refers to the continuous process of aligning game state data between the
                    server and clients to maintain consistency in the game world. This mechanism involves
                    transmitting player actions and game events to all connected participants, preventing
                    discrepancies in what different players experience.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-lua">
// Server-Side
RegisterServerEvent('updatePosition')
AddEventHandler('updatePosition', function(playerId, x, y, z)
    // The server receives new position data and sends it to all clients
    TriggerClientEvent('updateClientPosition', -1, playerId, x, y, z)
end)

// Client-Side
RegisterNetEvent('updateClientPosition')
AddEventHandler('updateClientPosition', function(playerId, x, y, z)
    // Each client receives and processes the new position data for the specified player
    SetEntityCoords(GetPlayerPed(playerId), x, y, z)
end)
</code></pre>
                <p>The code snippet above demonstrates basic data synchronization. The server receives new position
                    data for a player and broadcasts it to all clients using the 'updateClientPosition' event. Each
                    client then updates the specified player’s position using the received coordinates.</p>

                <h3>Optimizing Player Interactions</h3>
                <p>Minimizing latency is crucial for responsive gameplay. Techniques like client-side prediction can
                    be utilized. This means that clients will start rendering player actions immediately based on
                    predicted data and then adjust as the authoritative server data is received.</p>
                <p>For example, a client might begin rendering a player's movement immediately upon input, adjusting
                    the player’s position later based on data received from the server to ensure consistency and
                    responsiveness.</p>

                <h3>Securing Data Transactions</h3>
                <p>Securing data transactions involves validating, sanitizing, and protecting data as it travels
                    between the server and clients. All data received from clients should be scrutinized and
                    sanitized on the server-side to ensure the integrity and security of the game environment.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-lua">
// Server-Side validation example
RegisterServerEvent('playerAction')
AddEventHandler('playerAction', function(action)
    if validateAction(action) then
        // Process valid actions here
    else
        // Handle invalid actions: ignore, alert, or log them
    end
end)
</code></pre>
                <p>This code segment illustrates the principle of validating actions received from clients. The
                    server registers an event listener for 'playerAction', checks the validity of received actions,
                    and processes only those that pass the validation, thus maintaining a secure and stable game
                    environment.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Mastering Natives and Game Mechanics</h3>
                <p>Natives are integral functions provided by the game engine, facilitating interaction with and
                    manipulation of various game elements. Understanding and mastering natives is crucial for
                    crafting immersive gameplay experiences. Natives can be broadly utilized for numerous real-use
                    cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Player Manipulation:</strong> Natives allow you to change player attributes, control
                        player actions, and manipulate player status. For example, you can set the player’s health,
                        armor, or visibility, and even control the player’s movement and actions.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle Control:</strong> Spawn, modify, and control vehicles in the game world.
                        With natives, you can dynamically change vehicle colors, apply modifications, set vehicle
                        speed, or even create vehicle explosions for dramatic effect.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>World Interaction:</strong> Natives empower scripts to interact with the game world,
                        changing weather, time, or the environment dynamically. For instance, you can create a
                        script that changes the in-game weather based on real-world weather data.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AI Control:</strong> With natives, you can spawn and control NPC behaviors, create
                        AI-driven events, or even modify NPC attributes on-the-fly, crafting lively and interactive
                        game environments.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>User Interface Modification:</strong> Natives also enable the modification and
                        customization of the game's user interface, allowing scripts to display custom messages,
                        create interactive menus, or even develop unique HUD elements.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Optimization Techniques for Robust Scripts</h3>
                <p>For a seamless and responsive gaming experience, script optimization is crucial. Efficiently
                    managing resources and avoiding potential bottlenecks are fundamental practices in script
                    optimization.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-lua">
-- Efficient use of threads example
Citizen.CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        -- Perform task here
        Citizen.Wait(500) -- Introduce delay to reduce CPU usage
    end
end)
</code></pre>
                <p>This snippet uses <code class="language-lua">Citizen.CreateThread</code> to continually perform a
                    task but introduces
                    a delay with <code class="language-lua">Citizen.Wait(500)</code> to moderate CPU usage, facilitating
                    a more efficient
                    and performance-friendly loop structure.</p>

                <h3>Designing Engaging Gameplay Scenarios</h3>
                <p>Scripts that engage players often incorporate complex and interactive gameplay scenarios.
                    Implementing elements of randomness and player choice can significantly enhance game engagement
                    and replayability.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-lua">
-- Decision-based gameplay element example
local decision = math.random(1, 3)

if decision == 1 then
    TriggerEvent('eventA')
elseif decision == 2 then

    const results = await Database.query(`SELECT * FROM race_results WHERE player_id = ${playerId}`);
    return results;
}

const playerId = 123;
const raceResults = await fetchRaceResults(playerId);
console.log('Race results:', raceResults);
        </code></pre>

                <h4>Commonly Used JavaScript Natives</h4>
                <p>In GTA FiveM scripting, you'll frequently use JavaScript natives, functions provided by the game

                    <li><strong>TriggerEvent:</strong> For custom events, allowing communication between script parts or
                        resources.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>SetEntityCoords:</strong> To control in-game entity positions, useful for spawn points
                        or teleportation.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>GetPlayers:</strong> Retrieve a list of players, enabling interactions like sending
                        messages or performing actions.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RequestModel:</strong> For adding custom objects or vehicles.</li>

            <h2>Mastering FiveM Natives in Lua</h2>
            <p>Welcome to a comprehensive guide on mastering FiveM natives in Lua scripting. Here's an in-depth look at
                each aspect:</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3>Discovering Natives</h3>
                <p>Begin by exploring the <a href="https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/natives/"
                                             target="_blank">FiveM Natives Documentation</a>. This resource is your
                    go-to reference for finding native functions, their parameters, and usage. Use the search feature to
                    locate the specific natives you need for your Lua script.</p>

                <h3>Structuring Your Code</h3>
                <p>Effective organization of your Lua code is essential. Consider creating modular scripts or using
                    Lua's module system to encapsulate related functionality. Proper code structure enhances code
                    readability and maintenance. Here's an example of organizing code into a Lua module:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-lua">
-- Define a Lua module
local VehicleManager = {}

function VehicleManager.spawnVehicle(model, x, y, z)
    -- Implement your vehicle spawning logic
end

return VehicleManager
            </code></pre>

                <h3>Handling Dependencies</h3>
                <p>When working with external resources or libraries, efficiently manage dependencies. Clearly document
                    dependencies to ensure a smooth development process. You can use package managers like <a
                            href="https://luarocks.org/" target="_blank">LuaRocks</a> for Lua package management.</p>

                <h3>Optimizing for Performance</h3>
                <p>Optimizing Lua scripts is essential for better performance. Minimize resource-intensive operations,
                    reduce loops, and adopt asynchronous programming when needed. Here's an example of asynchronous
                    programming in Lua:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-lua">
-- Asynchronous function
local function fetchDataFromServer()
    Citizen.CreateThread(function()
        local response = PerformHttpRequest('https://api.example.com/data', function(data, statusCode, headers)
            -- Handle the response data
        end, 'GET', '', {})
    end)
end

-- Usage
fetchDataFromServer()
            </code></pre>
